# E-Commerce Website Analyze A/B Test and Regression

## Introduction
- Understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. They can either implement the new webpage, keep the old webpage, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. using Python, Probability, A/B Testing, and Regression .

1) Part I - Probability
2) Part II - A/B Test
3) Part III - Regression

## Conclusion
- After tests the three different tests, we came to the same result in all three, which is to keep the old page and not change it with the new page. As there is insufficient evidence to say that the new page conversion rate is higher than the old page conversion rate, and there is also no evidence that countries are affected by the conversion rate.
- It is better for the developer teams to design another new page or improve the old one.
